1. Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship and Composition is a "has-a" relationship.
2. In Inheritance, a class can extend only one interface and we can reuse the code only in one class.
   On the other hand, in Composition, we can resuse code in multiple class.
3. Inheritance exposes both public and protected method of the parent class. 
   However, Compisition doesn't expose. It interacts using public interface.
